Developed a COVID-19 protective device for health care workers that addresses shortcomings in current PAPRs and PPE. Designed a device that optimizes user comfort (including weight, ergonomics, etc.), and reusability from interviewing and working with doctors and nurses. 

Developed a viable solution to the preliminary design stage but unable to build a physical prototype due to covid restrictions. As shown in pictures in top right and bottom left, the device uses a fan/motor to pump air through filter and then to user. 

Focused on failure and risk analysis. Created full FMEA to identify high risk failure modes. Proposed experiments to test and mitigate risks.
