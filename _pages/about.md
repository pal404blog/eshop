I am currently one of thirty students specializing in Mechatronics under the Mechanical Engineering program at UBC. I have over one year of professional experience as a Product Engineer at IFD Technologies. I am also a member of the UBC Open Robotics design team building an autonomous domestic service robot, I am on the sub-team developing the 6-dof arm.

In my free time I love to stay active by hiking or playing sports. Growing up I played every sport I could. I even managed to represent team Canada twice playing baseball at the Intermidiate & Senior League World Series. Today, golf is one my favourite pastimes.

I also love to travel. I enjoy learning about different cultures and meeting people from all around the world. I have been to Korea, Australlia, New Zealand, Greece, Mexico and Cuba.
